            This is a personal project demonstrating my proficiency in creating
            a captivating memory game inspired by the Pok√©mon franchise.
            Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js, the
            project serves as a testament to my skills and dedication. The
            entire source code is openly accessible on my GitHub repository,
            allowing interested individuals to explore and gain insights from
            it.
